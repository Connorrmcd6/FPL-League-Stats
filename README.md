This Repo will provide some interesting stats on your FPL mini leagues, such has who took the most hits, who is the most consistent etc... You can choose to run the summary manually or have it sent to you on telegram.

Set-Up:
- Clone the repo
- Make a copy of "example_configs.py" and name it "configs.py"
- To get your league_id, visit https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues on your desktop and click on the leage you want to use
- Once you click on the preferred league, your URL will look something like https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues/{league_id}/standings/c
- copy the league_id from the url and assign it to the league_id variable in the configs.py file

Manual Mode:
if you wish to run the script without telegram, you can now run all in the summary_manual.ipynb file. The stats and plots will be printed out below each cell.
